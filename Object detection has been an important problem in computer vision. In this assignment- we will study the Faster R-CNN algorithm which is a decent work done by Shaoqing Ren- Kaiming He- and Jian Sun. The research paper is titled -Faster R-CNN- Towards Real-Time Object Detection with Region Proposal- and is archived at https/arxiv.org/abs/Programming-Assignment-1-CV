# Programming-Assignment-1-CV
Object detection has been an important problem in computer vision. In this assignment, we will
study the Faster R-CNN algorithm which is a decent work done by Shaoqing Ren, Kaiming He,
and Jian Sun. The research paper is titled “Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection
with Region Proposal”, and is archived at https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497.
